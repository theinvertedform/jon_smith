My [article on the history of Nationalist groups in Myanmar and India from decolonization to the present](https://everything2.com/title/Insurgent+Nationalism+in+Western+Southeast+Asia.?author_id=2200714#Oliver%20Smith) was published on everything2. It's intended to be a concise introduction to a very complex and often neglected topic. The groups involved in this conflict are often treated in isolation from one another but I argue that they are interrelated and developed in the context of the redivision of the world during the early beginning of the Cold War. Much of the literature on the topic is fraught with prejudices from this era and this make it difficult to find impartial writing about the topic so I intended this as sort of a corrective that is meant to challenge some assumptions before my narrative of historical events.
