**Oliver Smith Jones** is a scholar and researcher who lives in Montreal. I am currently enrolled in the Masters of Public Policy and Public Administration at Concordia University. My focus is the transhistorical development of contemporary ideologies during the late modern period, especially the application of these to statecraft in the colonial context of insular and continental Europe.
